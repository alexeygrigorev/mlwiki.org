## Temporal Databases
There are many applications that need temporal aspects in many domains. 

Usually they are used for:
- versioning
- specifying some periods of time
- etc


### Time and Facts
Valid time of a fact:
- when the fact is (was, will be) true in the modeled reality
- independent of the transaction time 
- can be past, present, future
- (link to [Slowly Changing Dimensions](Slowly_Changing_Dimensions))?

Transaction time of a fact:
- when the fact was recorded in a database
