# Inferential Statistics

## Inferential Statistics
It's a part of [Statistics](Statistics) that, based on a small [sample](Sampling) infers predictions about the population
- [Descriptive Statistics](Descriptive_Statistics) is another part that just describes samples and doesn't infer anything about the general population


"Statistical Inference" is concerned mainly with assessing the quality of parameter estimates 
- using some methods we estimate parameters and build statistical models from the sample 
- and we want to know how good the estimates/models are


### Variability in Estimates
- We estimate the parameters based on sampled data 
- So with different samples (from the same population) we get different estimates of the same parameter
- A one-number estimate of some population parameter is called [Point Estimate](Point_Estimate)
- The distribution of this parameter estimate is called [Sampling Distribution](Sampling_Distribution) 
- and the measure of variability is called [Standard Error](Standard_Error)

Main tools
- [Confidence Intervals](Confidence_Intervals)
- [Hypothesis Testing](Hypothesis_Testing)
