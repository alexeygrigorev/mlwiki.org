This is a family of [Statistical Tests](Hypothesis_Testing) that use [Chi-Squared Distribution](Chi-Squared_Distribution) to calculate values of the statistics 


### One-Way and Two-Way Tables
There are two type of tests 


One-Way Table Tests 
- counts for each outcome in a single variable, it's a [Frequency Table](Frequency_Table)
- it's for checking if the observed data comes from some distribution
- test: [Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test](Chi-Squared_Goodness_of_Fit_Test)


Two-Way Table Tests
- counts for combination of outcomes from two variables, it's a [Contingency Table](Contingency_Table)
- for checking if two categorical variables are independent
- test: [Chi-Squared Test of Independence](Chi-Squared_Test_of_Independence)
