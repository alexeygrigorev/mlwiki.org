# Pragmatic Investment Plan



- knowledge portfolio - your skills and talents
- manage it as you would manage your financial portfolio
- relating learning to "free" time is a recipe for failure
- be deliberate about it
- allocate appropriate time
- use this time wisely
- be more effective in learning


## Have a concrete plan
- be [SMART](Refactor_your_Wetware#SMART)
- different goals over time
  - now
    - buy a book
  - next year
    - be proficient
  - 3 years
    - write a book
- planning is important
  - "The planning is more important than the plan. The plan will change." Eisenhower.
 
## Diversify
- don't put all eggs into one basket
- consider risk vs return value
  - eg. .NET - low risk (mainstream technology), but low return on investment
  - Haskell - high risk (not mainstream), but may be the next language, and may go nowhere
- always valuable
  - but knowledge investment always brings value
  - it may impact the way you think
  - how you solve problems
  - so everything you learn is valuable

## Active investments
- have feedback
- ensure you can evaluate your plan
- you may want to revise your plan as you go

## Regular investments
- dollar-cost averaging
  - sometimes you pay too much
  - sometimes you get a great deal
  - it smoothes over time
- invest a minimal amount or time
- on regular basis
- on average it will bring good results

## Reevaluate your plan periodically
- what changed?
- what doesn't work?
- what will you do?
