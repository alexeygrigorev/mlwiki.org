# CURE Clustering

{{ stub }}

## CURE Algorithm for Clustering
Use a set of representative points to find non-global clusters 
- these points capture the geometry and shape of clusters 

{{ TODO |  see [Scalable Data Analytics and Data Mining AIM3 (TUB)](Scalable_Data_Analytics_and_Data_Mining_AIM3_(TUB)) lectures }} |

Choose points
- 2 farthest away points
- 3 and so on - furthest away from previous ones
- this procedure guarantees that the points are well distributed 

Then shrink the points towards the centroids by factor of $\alpha$ 


CURE eliminates outliers by discarding small slowly growing clusters 
- but it has a notion of center - not all shapes has natural center
