## Canopy Clustering

repeat
- sample a point
- form a group around this point 
  - other points that are within some similarity threshold
- remove closest points 


result
- set of (potentially overlapping) groups
- they are much smaller than the original dataset 


canopies reduce the computation time:
- for [Cluster Analysis](Cluster_Analysis)
- in general, for [KNN](KNN) queries
