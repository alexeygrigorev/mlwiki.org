## Computational Linguistics
Computational linguistics (CL) is a discipline between linguistics and computer science which is concerned with the computational aspects of the human language faculty. 
- It belongs to the cognitive sciences and overlaps with the field of [Artificial intelligence](Artificial_intelligence)
- Computational linguistics has applied and theoretical components.


What's the difference between [NLP](NLP) and Computational Linguistics?

CL:
- using computers for linguistic theory
- CL is a branch of Linguistics


NLP
- engineering a text processing application to solve particular task for particular reason
- NLP is a branch of [Machine Learning](Machine_Learning), [Statistics](Statistics) and engineering
- usually follows empirical approaches: collecting and analyzing lots of text data
- usually they are Shallow Models (see [Linguistic Models](Linguistic_Models))
