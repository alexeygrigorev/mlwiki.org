## Term Contribution
Idea: result of clustering highly depends on how similar are documents

so contribution of a term $t$ is how much it contributes to similarity of two documents

Text clustering is highly dependent on the documents similarity.
- Suppose use a [Dot Product](Dot_Product) based similarity:
- $\text{similarity}(d_i, d_j) =  \sum_{t \in V} f(t, d_i) \times f(t, d_j)$
  - where $f(t, d)$ represents the weight of term $t$ in document $d$


The contribution of each term is the overall contribution to documentsâ€™ similarities and shown by the following equation:

- $\text{TC}(t) = \sum_{i,j} f(t, d_i) \times f(t, d_j)$


It's slow - $O(n^2)$
- sample to speed it up
