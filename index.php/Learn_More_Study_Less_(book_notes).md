## Main concepts

### Constructs
- set of interlinked understandments
- when building constructs, you need to create as many links as possible

### Models
- simplified contructs
- compresses information
- visualization

### Highways
- linking between isolated constructs
- creativity, thinking "outside of the box"


## Sequence of Learning

### Acquire
- information enters
  - reading
  - taking notes
  - personal exprerimes
- goals
  - simplicity
    - lowest amount of redundancy
  - volume
    - the more the better
  - speed
    - works against simplicity and volume
- Test: Have I seen this idea before?

### Understand
- comprehension
- taking the raw information and giving it context
- most basic interlinking
- Test: Do I get what it means?

### Explore
- linking what you just learned to other concepts
- forming models to simplify and expand your constructs
- highways
- making well defined constructs
- types
  - Depth exploration
    - links into the information
    - where does it come from?
    - how it was made?
    - not just understand the formula - understand the proof
    - disadvantage: requires lots of researching
  - Lateral exploration
    - links around the information
    - What formulas are similar to?
    - What discoveries were made at the same time?
    - What other facts surrounding it?
    - requires less research but needs more creativity
  - Vertical exploration
    - finding patters
    - Can I compare it to a natural event?
- Techniques
  - Metaphor
  - Visceralization
  - Diagramms
- Test
  - Do I understand where it comes from?
  - What it's related to? 
  - What outside ideas can be connected to?

### Debug
- looking for errors in models and highways
- adding exceptions
- finding faults and contradictions
- how
  - seek information in other soursces
    - better in ones which oppose your views
  - testing it in the real world
- the only way to debug - is to practice
- Test
  - Have I removed bad links between the idea and other ideas?
  - Have I removed false conclusion?

### Apply
- how this operation operates in reality
- here the learning becomes complete
- Test: Have I used this idea in my practical life?

### Test
- continuous testing
- all the steps to be accompanied by testing
- allow to track your weaknesses
- you can improve on them


## Information Structure

### Arbitrary
- lots of facts, dates, definitions
- have no logical (obvious) grouping
- the hardest to remember
- dealing
  - make it less arbitrary - find a pattern
  - linking
  - pedding
  - compression

### Opinion
- essays/presentations at school
- look for patterns
- dealing
  - speed reading
  - diagramming

### Process
- based on some background
- eg
  - writing a program
  - builing a house
  - designing a protptype
- practice is the most important element
- dealing
  - visceralization
  - metaphor
  - diagramming
  - model debugging

### Concrete
- tangible
- easy to visualize
- have practical usage

### Abstract
- lacks the obvious connection to the real world
- eg
  - Maths
  - Physics
  - CS
- Complete opposite of Arbitrary
  - difficult to understand
  - patters are logical
- dealing
  - Visceralization
  - metaphor


## Techniques

### Aquiring

#### Speed Reading
- use a pointer
- practice reading
- measures
  - wpm - words per minute
  - comprehension
    - read for 3 minutes
    - write down every major idea/fact
      - without looking back at the book
    - go through it again and make a second list of ideas
    - c = (correct - incorrect) / (total number of facts)

#### Active reading
- write heading and subheadings for the chapter
- after each section make a few notes
  - major points
  - how can I remember them?
  - how I can extend and apply them?
- forces you to create links
  - metaphor
  - visualization
- makes you go beyond it and apply this in different context
- so it forces you to move each major point through
  - understanding
  - exploring
  - application
- example: classical conditioning
  - Major Points
    - discovered by Ivan Pavlov
    - connects a stimulus with a response
  - I remember it by
    - picturing Pavlov's dogs droding at the sound of bell
  - I extend it by
    - remembering how I feel compelled to answer the phone when hearing the same ringtone

#### Flow-Based Notetaking
- goal - build a surface for connecting ideas as they're reaching you
- uses fluid formar
- major ideas are written in several words
  - not entire sentence
- connect them using arrows
- hybrids
  - Flow-Based Afternotes
    - take regular notes
    - afterwards reform them into flow-based
    - gives readability and understanding
    - but requires more time
  - Flow-Based Commenting
    - for dense information flow
    - writing down the key info
    - inserting notes when there's a break

### Linking Ideas

#### Metaphor
- for abstract
- describing an object by linking it to smth irrelevant
- bridge between familiar topic and unfamiliar
- how
  - indentify the information
  - find smth in your experience that matches a part of this idea
    - couple of imperfect matches would do
  - repeat and check for circumstances where it doesn't applu
- improve
  - ask yourself for a metaphor
  - pick the first thing that comes to mind
  - refine and test your metaphors
  - repeat
  - collect multiple metaphors that explore ideas from different angles

#### Visceralization
- process of creating a mental image
- connects ideas with emotions
- works best for concrete information
- experimental
- how
  - identify the concept
  - pick a mental image to base this idea from 
    - make a draft on paper
  - Static/Dynamic?
    - visualize it moving
  - add other sences
  - refine and repeat until you can bring it just in a few seconds of thinking

#### Diagramming
- a simpler form of visceralization
- a diagram - picture, connecting several ideas together
- Flow-Based Diagrams
  - sequence of steps, events; a system
  - how
    - start with a single element
    - draw connection arrow to different ideas
    - for understanding - not for picture
      - less than 2 minutes|   |- Concept-Based Diagrams |  - start with the most important with branch off into details
- Image Diagrams
  - not a diagram
  - rather a doodle
  - to represent idea, association to others
  - 10-20 seconds

### Arbitrary

#### Linking
- close to rote memorization
- links a series like a linked list
- Step1. Create you sequence
  - write it down
  - or beak it down into a sequence
- Step2. Symbolize each in the list
  - create a symbol to associate with each element
    - a in a formula => apple
  - the symbol helps conjure the original concept
- Step3. Create the links
  - vivid and exaggerating image that connects two adjacent items
  - banana and cow => big banana with cow spots
- Imagination is needed|   | |#### Pegging
- no need to be in sequence
- link each element to a specific slot
  - 0 - hero
  - 1 - gun
  - 2 - shoe
  - 3 - tree
  - 4 - door
  - 5 - hive
  - 6 - sticks
  - 7 - heaven
  - 8 - plate
  - 9 - wine
  - 10 - pen
  - 11 - ribbon
  - 12 (dozen) - oven
  - note the rhyming
- eg
  - a bottle of wine is fighting with a knige
  - a knife is a symbol of labor
  - the 9th principle is the division of labor

#### Information Compression
- reduces size, so it can be associated together in a logical way
- Mnemonics
  - storing several ideas together by using a phrase/word
  - RED (first aid)
    - R - Rest the injured area
    - E - Elevate the injured ared
    - D - apply the direct pressure
- Picture linkung
  - link several ideas by representing them in one picture
  - done on paper
- Notes compression
  - take a lot of information
  - reduce it to just a few pages of notes
  - organizes large amounts of data
  - easier to connect ideas by looking at the entire sctructure
  - how
    - take several sheets of paper
    - write down major ideas
    - next to it write relevant formulas/concepts etc
    - continue until you've written down all the major ideas
    - you may rewrite it for better organization

### Extending
- Practice
  - apply everything you learned in your life
  - if you don't know how - do brainstorm
- Model Debugging
  - practice regularly
  - look for potential errors
  - make it timed
    - split practice into daily intervals
- Project-Based Learning
  - have a 1-3 month project
  - it forces you to learn
  - keep it small
  - write it down
    - commit to your project on paper
  - set a goal
    - objective outcome
