# ELECTRE

## ELECTRE
This is a method from the family of outranking (i.e. based on pair-wise comparison) [MCDA](MCDA) methods. The result is a partial ordering of alternatives (see [Partial Order Preference Structure](Partial_Order_Preference_Structure))

Here:
- ELECTRE I

ELECTRE I chooses alternatives that are preferred by the majority of the criteria and which donÂ’;t cause an unacceptable level of discontentment on other criteria. 


## Preferences
; Main idea: 
: When we say $a \ P \ b$?
- (1) if we have a lot of criteria for which $u_i(a) > u_i(b)$ (where $u_i$ - some utility function)
- (2) and we have no strong arguments that say the opposite of (1)


The ELECTRE methods are based on two concepts:
- Concordance Index 
- Discordance Index


### Concordance Index
Or quantification of positive arguments

For ELECTRE 1, when comparing $a$ and $b$
- identify all criteria $g_j$ such that $g_j(a) \geqslant g_j(b)$
- for all such criteria $g_j$ sum their weights $w_j$, 
- let $W$  be the sum of all weights: $W = \sum_i w_i$ (we use this for normalization)
- define the concordance index as:
- : $c(a, b) = \cfrac{1}{W} \sum_{j: g_j(a) \geqslant g_j(b)} w_j$

Note that weight should sum up to 1 

There are two extreme cases:
- $c(a, b) = 1$: all criteria for $a$ are better than for $b$ ([Unanimity](Unanimity))
  - have very good reasons to say $a \ P \ b$
- $c(a, b) = 0$: there is no criteria in which $a$ better than $b$ 


### Discordance Index
Or quantification of negative arguments 

We want to find a strong argument against $a \ P \ b$
- if we find such an argument then we cannot say that $a \ P \ b$

For ELECTRE I, define $d(a, b)$ as 
- 0 when $\forall j: g_j(a) \geqslant g_j(v)$ (none when there's [Unanimity](Unanimity))
- if $\exists g_i: g_i(b) \geqslant g_i(a)$ then we have an argument against $a \ P \ b$
- in this case we want to identify the largest difference between $a$ and $b$:
  - $\cfrac{1}{\delta} \max_j [g_j(b) - g_j(a)]$
  - $\delta$ is normalization factor: $\delta = \max_{i,c,d} [g_i(c) - g_i(d)]$


Another way 
- let $D$ be the set of cases where we list cases that cannot be compared 
- if for a pair of alternatives $(a, b)$ there exists a criteria $g_i$ s.t. $(g_i(a), g_i(b)) \in D$ then we cannot compare these alternatives 


### Outranking Preference Relation
For ELECTRE I we define $S \equiv P \lor I$ as: (the "as good as relations", also see [Voting Theory Relations](Voting_Theory_Relations))
- $a \ S \ b \iff$
  - (1) $c(a, b) \geqslant \tilde c$
  - : a lot of positive arguments to say $a \ S \ b$
  - (2) $d(a, b) \leqslant \tilde d$
  - : not many negative arguments to say the opposite
- so for that we also have to provide two parameters:
  - $\tilde c$ - the ''concordance threshold'' and $\tilde d$ - the ''discordance threshold''


Or:
- $a \ S \ b \iff$
  - (1) $c(a, b) \geqslant \tilde c$
  - (2) $\forall g_i: \big(g_i(a), g_i(b)\big) \not \in D$

Note that this relation gives us partial order:
- we have $P$ and $I$ (expressed via $S$) 
- and we have $J$ (when discordance threshold is exceeded)


## [Graph Kernel](Graph_Kernel)s
Graph Kernels are used to identify good alternatives. 

It is possible to express the outranking relation $S$ in form of a directed graph 

Example:
- <img src="https://raw.github.com/alexeygrigorev/wiki-figures/master/ulb/de/mcda/electree-graph.png" alt="Image">
- $a$ is better than $e$ and $d$
- $d$ is better than $f$ and $c$ 
- etc

A ''kernel'' of a graph $K \subset A$ is
- $\forall a \in K, \not \exists b: a \ S \ b$
- : no alternative $a$ inside the kernel $K$ is better than any other alternative $b$ inside $K$
- $\forall a,b \in K: a \ ? \ b$
- : within the kernel we cannot say anything about the relation between $a$ and $b$
- $\forall c \not \in K, \exists a \in K: a \ S \ c$
- : each alternative $c$ outside of the kernel $K$ is worse than at least one alternative $a$ inside $K$


For the example above:
- $K = \{b, d, e\}$

Another example
- <img src="https://raw.github.com/alexeygrigorev/wiki-figures/master/ulb/de/mcda/electree-graph-kernel2.png" alt="Image">


Remarks:
- If the graph has no cycles then the kernel is unique 
- Each cycle can be replaced by a single node (see [Strongly Connected Components](Strongly_Connected_Components))


The kernel $K$ of a set $A$ forms a set of preferred alternatives.



## Examples
### Example 1
|    |  price  |  comfort  |  speed  |  aesthetic  |   |   1   |  300  |  ex   |  fast  |  good  |   ||   2   |  250  |  ex   |  med   |  good  |   ||   3   |  250  |  med  |  fast  |  good  |  ||   4   |  200  |  med  |  fast  |  med   |  ||   5   |  200  |  med  |  med   |  good  |  ||   7   |  100  |  poor  |  med  |  med   |  ||   $w$  |  5    |  4    |  3     |  3     |  $W = \sum w = 15$ |

#### Concordance
Perform pair-wise comparisons for all elements $A$ 
- let's compare (1) and (2) 
- concordance: $c(1, 2) = \cfrac{1}{15} (4 + 3 + 3) = \cfrac{2}{3}$

This way we compare each with each:

|    |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7  |   1   |  -   |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10 ||   2   |  12  |  -   |  12  |  7   |  10  |  7   |  10 ||   3   |  11  |  11  |  -   |  10  |  10  |  10  |  10 ||   4   |  8   |  8   |  12  |  -   |  12  |  12  |  10 ||   5   |  8   |  11  |  12  |  12  |  -   |  12  |  10 ||   6   |  11  |  11  |  11  |  11  |  11  |  -   |  10 ||   7   |  5   |  8   |  5   |  8   |  8   |  9   |  - |
(note that this is not normalized - need also to divide on 15)


#### Discordance
In this case we define discordance by enumerating cases that are forbidden 

The following tables shows what veto we define 

|    |  price  |  comfort   |   $a$   |  250  |  poor ||   $b$   |  100  |  excellent  |

#### Graph
So the establish the following relation $S$ and the following graph:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/alexeygrigorev/wiki-figures/master/ulb/de/mcda/electree-ex1-graph.png" alt="Image">

There are two kernels in this case:
- 2, 4, 7
- : <img src="https://raw.github.com/alexeygrigorev/wiki-figures/master/ulb/de/mcda/electree-ex1-graph-kernel1.png" alt="Image">
- 2, 5, 7
- : <img src="https://raw.github.com/alexeygrigorev/wiki-figures/master/ulb/de/mcda/electree-ex1-graph-kernel2.png" alt="Image">

Kernel:
- 6 is dominated - remove it
- same for 3 and 1
- since there's a cycle we have to decide between 4 and 5, and remove one of them
- when we put alternatives into a kernel, it doesn't mean they are the best, but it means it allows to apply the [Dominance](Dominance) principle and remove dominated alternatives


### Example 2
- A company wants to rank 5 candidates $A,B,C,D,E$ for a promotion 
- Criteria:
  - Reputation of diploma $D$
  - Skills $K$
  - Personality $P$
  - Spoken Languages $L$
  - Seniority $S$
- Apply ELECTRE with concordance threshold 0.6 and discordance 6 

The following evaluation table is obtained

|    |  $A$  |  $B$  |  $C$  |  $D$  |  $E$  |  Weight  |   $D$   |  7  |  11  |  15  |  11  |  16  |  15 ||   $K$   |  12  |  18  |  6  |  8  |  10  |  15 ||   $P$   |  13  |  13  |  14  |  19  |  10  |  15 ||   $L$   |  18  |  16  |  19  |  13  |  19  |  25 ||   $S$   |  10  |  20  |  16  |  14  |  20  |  20 |
Total weight is $W = 15 + 15 + 15 + 25 + 20 = 100$


#### Concordance
Then we construct the concordance index by comparing alternatives pair-wise


For example, consider alternatives $A$ and $B$

|    |  $A$ vs $B$  |  $B$ vs $A$   |   $D$   |      |  15   ||   $K$   |      |  15 ||   $P$   |  25  |  25 ||   $L$   |  25  |   ||   $S$   |      |  20 ||  '''Total'''  |  50  |  100 ||  '''Normalized'''  |  0.5  |  0.75 |
Repeating this for all pairs, construct the following table: 

|     |  $A$  |  $B$  |  $C$  |  $D$  |  $E$  |   $A$   |  -  |  '''0.75'''  |  0.15  |  0.4  |  0.4  ||   $B$   |  0.5  |  -  |  0.35  |  '''0.75'''  |  '''0.6'''  ||   $C$   |  '''0.85'''  |  '''0.65'''  |  -  |  '''0.6'''  |  0.5  ||   $D$   |  '''0.6'''  |  0.25  |  0.4  |  -  |  0.25  ||   $E$   |  '''0.6'''  |  '''0.6'''  |  '''0.75'''  |  '''0.75'''  |  -  |

'''Bold''' are alternatives that should be preferred provided that there's no discordance
- recall that $\tilde c = 0.6$ and we check all values that $\geqslant \tilde c$


#### Discordance
The discordance index is $\tilde d = 6$
- we don't normalize on $\delta$ here because our values are already normalized 


Let's compare $A$ with $B$ and $A$ with $C$:

|    |  $A$ vs $B$  |  $B$ vs $A$  |  $A$ vs $C$  |  $C$ vs $A$   |   $D$   |   7  |  -  |  '''8'''  |  -  ||   $K$   |   6  |  -  |  -  |  '''6''' ||   $P$   |  0  |  0  |  1  |  - ||   $L$   |  -  |  '''2'''  |  1  |  - ||   $S$   |  '''10'''  |  -  |  6  |  - ||  '''Max'''  |  ''10''  |  2  |  ''8''  |  ''6''  ||   Rel   |  $A \ J \ B$  |   |  $A \ J \ C$  |  $C \ J \ A$ |
- if a difference exceeds the threshold, the alternatives are incomparable 


#### Graph
Based on the Concordance and Discordance we define the outranking relation $S$
- this relation can be depicted as a graph
