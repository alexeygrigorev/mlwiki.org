## Function Spaces
A function space is a [vector space](Vector_Spaces) where "vectors" are functions


Properties:
- functions are not just $n$ points like vectors, but they are the entire continuum 
- this is a vector space, but "vectors" are functions: they have inner product with $\int$ instead of $\sum$, and they also have orthogonality
- [Inner Product](Inner_Product): $\langle f, g \rangle = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, g(x) \, dx$
- [Orthogonal Functions](Orthogonal_Functions): if the inner product of $f$ and $g$ is 0 then $f$ and $g$ are orthogonal
- this is an inner product for functions: we multiply the values for every $x$ and sum them using integral
