# Unanimity

## Unanimity
The unanimity principle is a [Voting Theory](Voting_Theory) principle. ''Unanimity'' means "agreement reached by all people".

Using [Voting Theory Relations](Voting_Theory_Relations) for $N = 2$ we define Unanimity as:
- if $x \ P_1 \ y$ and $x \ P_2 \ y$ then  $x \ P \ y$
- or $x$ is globally preferred to $y$ if both voters vote for $x$

It follows from two principles
- Non-Imposition and [Monotonicity](Monotonicity)
- shown in [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](Arrow's_Impossibility_Theorem) ([Unanimity consequence](Arrow's_Impossibility_Theorem#Consequence_1__Unanimity))

If a candidate $a$ is always preferred by the majority to $b$, then we can say that $b$ is dominated by $a$ and never consider $b$ again


## Dominance
The same concept in different disciplines is also often called [Dominance](Dominance)

- [Game Theory](Game_Theory)
