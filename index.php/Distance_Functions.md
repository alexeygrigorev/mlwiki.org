# Distance Functions

{{stub}}

## Distance
A metric function (or distance) is a generalization of geometric distance (i.e. [Euclidean Distance](Euclidean_Distance))


Direct similarity measures are not always reliable for high-dimensional clustering (see Guha1999)
- [Euclidean Distance](Euclidean_Distance)
- [Edit Distance](Edit_Distance)


Similarity is the opposite of distance
- usually can be turned to distance 
- [Cosine Similarity](Cosine_Similarity) and [Dot Product](Dot_Product)
- [Jaccard Coefficient](Jaccard_Coefficient)


Non-metric
- [KL Divergence](KL_Divergence)
