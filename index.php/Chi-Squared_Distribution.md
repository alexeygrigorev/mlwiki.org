## Chi-Squared Distribution
- always positive 
- typically right-skewed 
- one param: $\text{df}$

- when df becomes larger, the center moves, i.e. the mean value grows as well
- mean = df
- variability increases as df increases 
- shape becomes less skewed, more symmetric 
- for Chi-Squared tests typically need only upper-tail values
