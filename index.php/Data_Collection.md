## Data Collection
In [Statistics](Statistics), there is 
- a research question about the target population
- and we need to answer it based on some data
- how to get the data?

### [Sampling](Sampling)
- Typically cannot get the data for the entire population
- Can take a fraction of this data - this is called [Sampling](Sampling) 


### Types
There are several types of data collection: 
- [Observational Studies](Observational_Studies) - monitor and record 
  - sufficient to show association
  - not sufficient to show causation
- [Statistical Experiment](Statistical_Experiment)s - conduct an experiment and collect the data 
  - sufficient to show causation when the experiment is designed carefully
