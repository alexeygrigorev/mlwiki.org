# Decision Under Risk

## Decision Under Risk
In contrast to [Decision Under Uncertainty](Decision_Under_Uncertainty) models, here we assume that we can assign probabilities to consequences 


[Decision Trees](Decision_Tree_(Decision_Theory)) and simple lotteries are the main tool for expressing decision taking process and associated risk 

These lotteries are compared by the decision maker and he chooses the best option:
- [Expected Values for Lotteries](Expected_Values_for_Lotteries) - limited approach
  - susceptible to paradoxes such as [Saint Petersburg Paradox](Saint_Petersburg_Paradox)
- [Expected Utility Approach](Expected_Utility_Approach) - more preferred
