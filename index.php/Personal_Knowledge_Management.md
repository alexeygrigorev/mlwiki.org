### schemata (Big6)
- locating

    - where can it be found?
  - finding sources of information
- selecting/analyzing

  - knowledge and solutions are developed
  - facts vs opinions
  - comparisons
  - organizing ideas logically

  - presentation to an appropriate audience
  - a paper
- evaluating
  - critical evaluation of completion

### KM
- cognitive science
- expert systems, AI
- knowledge base management systems
- groupware

- etc

### objectives
- enhance collaboration

### goals
- identify
- create
- represent
- distribute
- enable adoption of
- insights and experiences
- and transform it into knowledge

### knowledge
- tacit
  - internal
- explicit

## Personal Knowledge Base

### PKB
- personal

- base
  - consolidated knowledge store

### knowledge capture tools
- mind mapping
  - diagrams to visually outline information
  - major categories radiate from central node
  - free form
  - spatial layout
  - a tree
  - guidelines - see @ wiki
  - uses
    - generate, visualize, classify ideas
    - aids for students
    - problem solving
    - summarizing
- concept mapping
  - based on assimilation theory of knowledge
    - newly encountered knowledge must be related to prior knowledge
  - CM depicts these connections graphically
  - links are labeled
    - typically with a verb phrase
- hyperlink systems
  - non-linear dynamic hyperdocument
  - piece of text linked together
- note-taking

### benefits
- knowledge generation of formulation
- knowledge capture
- knowledge management and retrieval
- integration heterogenous sources
