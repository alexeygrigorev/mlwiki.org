## Flowshop Problem
This is a [Multi-Objective Optimization](Multi-Objective_Optimization) Problem.

Given:
- $M$ products
- $N$ machines
- each product:
  - has to pass through machine once (in the same sequence $1, 2, ..., N$)
  - has some due date 
  - has delay for each machine 

There are two objectives:
- minimize makespan (produce as fast as possible)
- minimize total tardiness (be able to meet deadlines)
