# Outliers

## Outliers
- Outliers: refers to objects with characteristic different from most of the other objects

Can detect by
- [Summary Statistics](Summary_Statistics) 
- [Box Plot](Box_Plot)s
- Other visualization techniques - [Plot](Plot)s
- more advanced approaches like [Anomaly Detection](Anomaly_Detection)

## Visualization
### Modified [Box Plot](Box_Plot)
Modified box plot
- is a variation of the box plot
- can be used to find outliers

### [Scatter Plot](Scatter_Plot)
Also if we just draw the values, it'll be possible to see the outliers

## Models and Outliers
Some Statistical, [ML](Machine_Learning) and [DM](Data_Mining) models are sensible to outliers
- e.g. [Linear Regression](Linear_Regression)
- it's important to detect them and only after build a model
