# Continuous Functions

{{stub}}

## Continuous Functions
A [Function](Function) $f(x)$ is continuous if the [Limit](Limit) of this function always exists
otherwise the function is discontinuous


- $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = a$ if $\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ 
- $f(x)$ is continuous everywhere if its continuous for all $a$ in the '''domain''' of $f(x)$


Many functions are continuous, for example: 
- [Polynomial Functions](Polynomial_Functions)
- [Rational Functions](Rational_Functions)
- [Trigonometric Functions](Trigonometric_Functions)
- [Exponential Functions](Exponential_Functions) and [Logarithms](Logarithms)


Careful|   |- some functions might look discontinuous, but they may be continuous |- this is the case when the discontinuously-looking points are not in the domain 
- but if the function is defined in this point, then it's discontinuous
