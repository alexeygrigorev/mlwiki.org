## First Order Logic
First Order Logic (FOL)
- Logic is the foundation of [Knowledge Representation](Knowledge_Representation)
- inferences expressed in logical statements are basis for [Knowledge Discovery](Knowledge_Discovery)
- languages like [OWL](OWL) - can be viewed as a specialization of FOL


### Inference
In FOL, inference is generally [undecidable](Decidability)
- there is a subset of FOL, called [Descriptive Logic](Descriptive_Logic), where it becomes tractable

- [FOL](First_Order_Logic) give formal definitions of RDFS and OWL statements 
  - Classes - unary predicates
  - Properties - binary predicates
- [DL](Descriptive_Logic) is a subset of FOL where many interesting properties are decidable
