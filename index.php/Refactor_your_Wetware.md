## Dreufus model

### Stages
- Novices
  - want to know exactly how smth is done
  - little/no experience
  - not sure of the outcome
  - don't want to learn
  - want to accomplish an immediate goal
- Advanced beginners
  - no holistic understanding
  - little context
- Competent
  - develop conceptual model
  - plan deliberately
  - base on past experience
  - have troubles to decide what to focus on
- Proficient
  - need big picture
  - learn on expertise of others 
  - learn on how they've done and revise
  - know where to stop following rules
- Experts
  - primary source of knowledge
  - apply it in the right context
  - work from intuituion
  - have problems to articulate expertise
  - rules ruin them

### Become an expert
- Deliberate practice
  - 10 years
  - challenging but doable tasks
  - with feedback
  - with ability to repeat and correct errors
- 3 phases of learning
  - Imitate (Shu)
    - without modification
  - Assimilate (Ha)
    - reflect
  - Innovate (Ri)
    - transcend


## Brain

### L-mode
- what like
  - von Neumann-like
  - linear
  - slow
- characteristics
  - verbal
  - analytic
  - symbolic
  - abstract
  - temporal
  - rational
  - digital
  - logical
  - linear
- for
  - working through details
  - for white-collar information-based workers

### R-mode
- what like
  - non-linear
  - fast
  - pattern-matching
- characteristics
  - needs whole picture
  - intuitive
  - makes insights
  - non-verbal
  - non-rational
  - synthetic
  - analogic
  - intuitive
  - hollistic
  - non-linear
- for
  - intuition
  - problem solving
  - creativity
  - long term memory
  - relating things together
- not controllable directly
- stores everything, but not everything is indexed
  - you can recall when needed
- works asynchronously
- needed for becoming an expert


  only one has the access to the CPU (brain)


## Right Mind

### Capture insights
- capture all ideas to get more of them
- how
  - pen and notepad
  - index cards 
  - smartphones
  - voice memos

### add sensory activities
- activates more neural pathways
- engages more of your brain
- use cross-sensory feedback
  - write down in usual form
  - draw a visual metaphor
  - describe it verbally
- your mind is hungry for these stimuli

### R-to-L flow
- ideas
  - R-mode - source of ideas
  - L-mode - verification
- Metaphor
  - act of creating analogies
  - where L and R meet
  - links abstract notions to concrete
  - random juxtaposition
    - take a word and connect it to unrelated one
    - the further ideas are, the harder to join them
  - cultivate humor
    - have you seen my fishbowl?
    - yes, it's just got a strike|   | |### learn to be comfortable with uncertainty
- perfectionism may be dangerous

Think outside the box


## Harvest R-mode clues

### ideas from R-mode are hard to verbalize

### Image Streaming
- pose a problem/ask a question
- close your eyes ~10 mins
- for each image that you see
  - try to see as many details as you can
  - describe it out loud

### Free-Form Journalism
- write as much as possible
- blog posts/letters/everything

### [The morning pages technique](Утренние_страницы)

- first thing in the morning
- while L is still sleeping
  - unguarded brain dump
- write 3 pages
- by hand, no computer
- do not censor it
- do not skip a day

### Fieldstone Method
- don't plan ahead
- just walk around and pick up good-looking stones
- eventually you'll collect a pile
- when it's time, find in the pile ones you like
- and use them
- once you have a pile, it's easy to build a wall

### Harvesting by Walking
- do something that bores L-mode
- so R-mode frees up
- dump everything on paper
- free up your mind
- walk and don't think
  - as soon as you focus, L-mode dominates
  - you don't want it
- so, step away from the keyboard to solve hard problems

### change your viewpoint
- look at smth in reverse
- turn the problem around
  - instead of debugging for problems
  - try to cause the bug
- exaggerate

### reconcile unlike patterns
- 100 oblique strategies
  - statements that force you to draw analogies
  - "what else is this like?"
- Shakespeare's Brain Teaser
  - new words, phrases
  - unusual context for words
  - unusual part of speech
  - fundamental shift - makes you think


## Debug

### cognitive biases
- anchoring
- fundamental attribution error
  - "rarely" doesn't mean never
  - Black Swans
- need for closure
  - closure: we need to eliminate uncertainty
  - defer closure
  - the more you know - the better
  - be comfortable with uncertainty
- confirmation bias
- exposure effect
- hawthorne effect
- false memory
  - memory is unreliable

### general affinity
- types
  - risk taker vs rick adverse
  - individualism vs teamwork
  - stability vs freedom
  - family vs work
- Mayer Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
  - Extravert (E) vs Introvert (I)
  - Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)
    - how do you obtain information?
    - S - based on the details at the moment
    - N - imagination, intuition
  - Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)
    - how do you make decisions?
    - T - based on rules
    - F - base on emotional impact
  - Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)
    - J - early closure
    - P - don't like making decisions
  - The combination defines your temperament

### personal tendencies
- trust intuition, but verify
- if you feel smth, prove it
  - create a prototype
  - run unit tests
  - benchmarks
  - get the feedback|   |- unittest your intuition |  - how do you know?
  - says who?
  - how specifically?
  - how does what I'm doing cause you to ... ?
  - compared to what/whom?
  - does it always happen? are there exceptions?
  - what would happen if I did (didn't) ...?
  - what stops you from ... ?
- get statistics
- expect better
- "it's by logic we prove, it's by intuition we discover"

### hardware bugs
- most of out brain is primitive
- knee-jerk reaction - faster than brain
- let yourself think before act


## Learn

### Learning
- ability to learn - most important element of success
- random approach without goals and feedbacks tends to random results 
- "the body of knowledge" isn't the most important part
- more relevant
  - models you build
  - questions you ask
  - your experience and practice

### Setting goals
- "I want to be fit" - vision, not a goal
- a goal needs a series of objectives
- goal - desired state
- objective - smth you do to get closer to your goal

### SMART
- (S)pecific
  - narrow down to something concrete
  - "I want to be able to write a webserver in Erlang that dynamically generates content"
- (M)easurable
  - how do you know when you done?
  - take small bites and measure steady, incremental progress
  - you have to see only 2/3 feet ahead
- (A)chievable
  - need to be realistic
  - attainable from where you are _now_
- (R)elevant
  - are you passionate about it?
  - it needs to matter
- (T)ime-boxed
  - needs a deadline

### [Pragmatic Investment Plan](Pragmatic_Investment_Plan)
- knowledge portfolio - your skills and talents
- manage it as you would manage your financial portfolio
- relating learning to "free" time is a recipe for failure
- be deliberate about it
- allocate appropriate time
- use this time wisely
- be more effective in learning
- PIP
  - have a concrete plan
    - be SMART
    - different goals over time
      - now
        - buy a book
      - next year
        - be proficient
      - 3 years
        - write a book
    - planning is important
      - "The planning is more important than the plan. The plan will change." Eisenhower.
  - diversify
    - don't put all eggs into one basket
    - consider risk vs return value
      - eg. .NET - low risk (mainstream technology), but low return on investment
      - Haskell - high risk (not mainstream), but may be the next language, and may go nowhere
    - always valuable
      - but knowledge investment always brings value
      - it may impact the way you think
      - how you solve problems
      - so everything you learn is valuable
  - make active (not passive) investments
    - have feedback
    - ensure you can evaluate your plan
    - you may want to revise your plan as you go
  - make regular investments
    - dollar-cost averaging
      - sometimes you pay too much
      - sometimes you get a great deal
      - it smoothes over time
    - invest a minimal amount or time
    - on regular basis
    - on average it will bring good results
- reevaluate your plan periodically
  - what changed?
  - what doesn't work?
  - what will you do?

### Learning modes
- how _you_ can learn?
- types of perception
  - Visual
    - need to see material
    - picture, graphs
  - Auditory
    - have to hear
    - lectures, seminars, podcasts
  - Kinesthic

    - need to physically experience the material
- Three-part mind
  - meta-level component
    - manages thought process
  - performance-based component
    - for making associations
  - knowledge-acquisition component
    - assimilating new information
  - each component is independent
- Frames of Mind

    - and discuss
  - formal
    - deliberate steps:
    - select a proposal and its leader
    - buy books
    - schedule meetings
- SQ3R
  - Survey
    - scan the table of contents
    - see for overview
  - Question

- Mind maps
  - diagrams that shows topics and how they are connected
  - notetaking
    - raw notes - while listening
    - then transfer to "official" notes
  - should be hand-written
    - start with messy mind-map
    - then reorganize and redraw
  - exercise
    - take 4-5 items bullet list
    - draw a mind map
    - wait a day
    - enhance it with colors
    - review a week later
  - good for 
    - brainstorming
    - exploring
    - collaboration
- Documentation
  - documenting may be more important than documentation
  - mental preparation
    - turns on your attention
    - gets insight
  - you may take time to create a screen cast
- Learn by teaching
  - clarifies your own understanding
  - try to explain it to smb
  - even if it's an yellow rubber duck
  - constant retrieval of information is very effective for learning
  - preparation is also very important (see documentation)


## Experience

you have to learn by doing

### play in order to learn
- explore and build mental models
- constructivism
  - we build to learn
  - not learn to build
- don't be afraid of mistakes
  - they provide feedback
- make a game out of learning
  - flashcards
  - lego blocks

### problem?
- can you break it down into smaller meaningful parts?
- is it like others?
- can you adapt other situations to match it?
  - i.e. leverage existent knowledge
  - danger: beware of differences

### failures
- after a failure
  - we study what happened
  - what went wrong
  - learn how to fix it
- it's important to get it right _last_ time (first is not that important)
- ensure safety
  - freedom to experiment
  - ability to backtrack to a stable state
  - ability to demonstrate progress
- 2 types of failures
  - we can learn from them
  - we cannot learn from them
- allow failures
  - pressure shuts your mind down
  - your vision narrows
  - so give yourself permission to fail
  - you don't necessarily have to make errors
  - create "failure permitted" zones

### Imagination overrides senses
- that can improve your perfomance
- always be the worst
  - be in the company with smarter people
  - you'll mimic others
- groove your mind for success
- scaffolding
  - make smth help you do smth
    - swimmers + rope
  - you'll adjust to higher speed/etc
  - unscaffolding
    - then it'll be easier to handle under usual circumstances
    - work in C++ after ruby and then get back


## Focus

### focus and attention
- attention - act of focusing in
- your attention - a short supply
- when we say "we don't have time" we mean "we're running out of attention"
- meditation
  - allocates attention
  - Vipassana meditaion
    - you're aware
    - but don't render judgements
    - and don't making responses
  - technique
    - find a quiet spot
    - sit in a comfortable posture, with a straight back
    - become aware of any tension and let it go
    - close eyes and focus on breath
    - be aware of the rhythm of your breath
      - don't try to change it
    - focus on nothing else but breath
    - if you wander off, let thoughts go and focus back
- learn to pay attention

### knowledge
- information - raw data
- knowledge - meaning for the information
- manage your knowledge
  - input (raw data)
    - ideas
    - insights
  - processing
  - output
    - processed and transcended
- you need to work with the material
  - organize 
  - develop
  - coalesce disparate
  - refine
  - from general to specific
- exocortex (external support)
  - book collection
  - notes
  - etc
- personal wiki
  - knowledge and information management
  - good wiki feels like a mind map
  - by organizing your ideas you'll get more of them
  - wiki gardening
    - rearranging/refactoring your wiki

### optimizing the context
- context - things you're focusing on at the moment
- context switching is very expensive|   |  - 20-40% of productivity eaten by switching contexts |- manage interruptions deliberately
  - use virtual desktops
