# Statistical Experiment

## Statistical Experiments
There are two types of [Data Collection](Data_Collection)
- [Observation Studies](Observation_Studies) and Statistical Experiments


### Variables in Experiments
- ''Response variable'' (or ''dependent variable'') - the outcome of interest, measured on each subject or entry participating in the study
- ''Explanatory variable'' (or ''predictor'', or ''independent variable'') - a variable that we think may help to explain the value of the response variable.


### Experiment
- ''Experiment'' - when a researcher manipulates the explanatory variable to see the effect on the response. 
- So they ''create'' the data


### Correlation and Causation
- with this type of studies it is possible to show the causal relationship between the variables


Example
- Suppose we run a sunscreen study and collected some data
- We saw that the more sunscreen is used, the more chances to have skin cancer 
- does sunscreen causes the cancer? 
- cannot say it here because the study is [observational](Observational_Studies)
- e.g. in this case  we don't see the exposure to sun - it's correlated with both sunscreen and cancer variables
  - this is a [Confounding Variable](Confounding_Variables) that is likely to have caused the effect
- but if we do a randomized experiment, we can see if there's any causal relationship 



## Randomized Experiments
Randomized Experiments
- individuals are assigned to groups
- researches assigns treatments to the groups
- typically assignment is done at random - which is why it's called "Randomized Experiments"


### Principles of Experimental Design
- Controlling
- Randomization 
- Replication
- Blocking


### Controlling
- We want to see if there's any causal relationship between the variables
- so do the best to control any other difference in the group
  - to make sure there's nothing else that might interfere with the experiment (no [Confounding Variables](Confounding_Variables))
  - e.g. the exposure to sun in the previous example

Example
- specify that a pill must be taken with exactly 200ml glass of water 
- not with a sip or 1 liter 


### Randomization
- Assign cases to treatment groups at random 
- This way accounting for variation that cannot be controlled by the researcher 
- it keeps uncontrolled differences even and prevents from adding accidental [Bias](Bias)


### Replication
- Make sure the experiment may be run again and the findings can be replicated


### Blocking
- Researchers sometimes may suspect that some variables (not only treatment) may influence the response
- in such a case, group individuals into blocks and then randomize within the blocks
- this way ensuring that there's equal number of patients within each group 

Example
- first divide patients into low-risk, mid-risk and high-risk groups
- then randomize within each risk group 


## Reducing [Bias](Bias)
To reduce the bias in the human experiments, split the patients into two groups: 
- treatment group - receives the medicine
- control group - receive placebo


### Double-Blind Setup
- but if a doctor knows that this patient is going to receive a placebo, it may impose some emotional effect on the doctors - it's difficult to quantify 
- which is why both patients and the doctors are kept uninformed of what type of medicine they receive 
- it's called a ''double-blind setup''
