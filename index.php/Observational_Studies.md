## Observation Studies
There are two types of [Data Collection](Data_Collection)
- Observation Studies and [Statistical Experiment](Statistical_Experiment)s

In ''Observation Studies'' we observe existing characteristics of a subset of individuals in a population
- typically done via surveys, by following smb, etc
- this method doesn't directly interfere with how the data appear (in contrast to [Statistical Experiment](Statistical_Experiment)s)


the goal is to
- draw conclusions about the population or 
- find differences between 2 or more groups or
- find out about the relationships between variables


### Types
- Prospective Study 
  - collect the data as an event unfolds
- Retrospective Study
  - use the data of some event that already took place 


## Finding Relationships
Types of variables: 
- outcome - the variables of our interest
- explanatory - the variables that are used to analyze and explain the outcome


### Types of Relationships
The relationships between the explanatory variable and the outcome
- ''independent'': there is no association between the variables
- ''association'': the variables are dependent, but it's not clear what kind of relationship there is
  - ''causes'': changes in the explanatory variables case the outcome to change 
  - ''reverse causation'': changes in outcome cause the explanatory variable to change
  - ''coincidence'': just pure chance
  - ''common cause'': some other variable causes both the explanatory variables and the outcome to change (see also [Confounding Variables](Confounding_Variables))


### Correlation and Causation
- with this type of studies it is possible to find association relationship between the variables
- but it's not possible to show the causation here - need to run a controlled [Statistical Experiment](Statistical_Experiment) for that 
- beware of [Confounding Variables](Confounding_Variables)


Example
- Suppose we run a sunscreen study and collected some data
- We saw that the more sunscreen is used, the more chances to have skin cancer 
- does sunscreen causes the cancer? 
- cannot say it here because the study is observational - we didn't run a controlled [Statistical Experiment](Statistical_Experiment) to make sure there are no other variables that might have caused it
- e.g. in this case  we don't see the exposure to sun - it's correlated with both sunscreen and cancer variables
  - this is a [Confounding Variable](Confounding_Variables) that is likely to have caused the effect
