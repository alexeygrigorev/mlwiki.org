## Genetic Algorithms
This is a group of algorithms that aim at solving [Optimization](Optimization) problems with ideas borrowed from biology (evolutions)

General idea:
- start with a population of potential solutions 
- score each solution
- select the best (only the best "survive")
- perform some random mutations (permutations, etc)
- combine the solutions in hope to get a better one (cross-over)
- repeat for several generations 



## Applications
This model is successfully applied in many domains:
- in [Process Mining](Process_Mining): [Genetic Process Miner](Genetic_Process_Miner)


## Sources
- [Business Process Management (ULB)](Business_Process_Management_(ULB))
