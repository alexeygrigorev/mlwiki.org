## Monotonicity
The monotonicity is a [Voting Theory](Voting_Theory) criterion/principle that characterizes voting methods for choosing the winner. 


''Monotonicity'' is satisfied when:
- if 
  - an alternative $x$ rises or does not fall in the individual ordering and
  - $x$ was preferred to another alternative $y$ before the change in the individual orderings
- then
  - (1) $x$ should still remain at least at the same position
  - (2) if $x$ is a winner, it should remain the winner
  - (note that (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2))


## Theorems
This principle is used in two important [Voting Theory](Voting_Theory) theorems:
- [May's Theorem](May's_Theorem)
- [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](Arrow's_Impossibility_Theorem)


## Methods
Methods that respect Monotonicity:
- [Plurality Voting](Plurality_Voting)
- [Borda's Rule](Borda's_Rule)

Methods that don't respect Monotonicity
- [Two-Round Voting](Two-Round_Voting)
- [Condorcet's Rule](Condorcet's_Rule)
