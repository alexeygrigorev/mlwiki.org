## Game Theory
In Game Theory the decision of a decision maker and its consequences are based on somebody else's decisions


### Game
A ''game'' is a ''strategic interaction'' (in economics, social studies, networking, etc) between two or more ''self-interested agents''

Each agent has his/her own opinions and preferences

The ''outcome'' of a game depends on what all agents do
- what actions a game player takes?
- all users act in the same way?
- is there a global behavior pattern?
- if players can communicate, what effect it will have?
- repetitions?
- does it matter if opponents are rational?


Example:
- Suppose we have two airline companies $P_1$ and $P_2$
- They are both thinking about about opening a new destination 
- Both consider two options: either make tickets cheap or make them expensive 
- Clearly if $p_1$ decides to sell cheap tickets while $p_2$ - to sell expensive tickets, everybody will buy from $p_1$

So we can depict it with the following pay-off matrix
- a cell represents consequences of the decision that both players take

|   $p_2 \leftarrow$ <br/> $p_1 \downarrow$  |  500  |  200   |   500   |  (50, 100)  |  (-100, 200) ||   200   |  (150, -200)  |  (-10, -10) |
We see that:
- if both agree on cheap tickets - both will have profits
- if $p_2$ sells expensive tickets and $p_1$ cheap ones, all go to $p_1$ and $p_2$ will have losses
- the same with $p_1$ and $p_1$
- if both decide on expensive tickets - nobody will buy them and they both will experience losses

This is a variation of the [Prisoner's Dilemma](Prisoner's_Dilemma), an example of [Normal Form Game](Normal_Form_Game)


### Types of Games
There are many types of games:
- [Normal Form Game](Normal_Form_Game) (also Strategic Game)
- [Extensive Form Game](Extensive_Form_Game)
- [Mixed-Strategy Game](Mixed-Strategy_Game)
- [Repeated Game](Repeated_Game)
- [Coalitional Game](Coalitional_Game)
- [Bayesian Game](Bayesian_Game)


### Rationality
It is often assumed that agents behave rationally:
- a ''rational agent'' wants to maximize the consequence (utility, etc)
- There are some important principles:
- The [Dominance](Dominance) principle (same as [Unanimity](Unanimity)) [Iterative Removal](Iterative_Removal)
- [Nash Equilibrium](Nash_Equilibrium)


### Examples
Paradoxes
- [Prisoner's Dilemma](Prisoner's_Dilemma)

[Pure Competition Game](Pure_Competition_Game)s
- [Matching Pennies](Matching_Pennies) (also "Head or Tail" game)

[Cooperation Game](Cooperation_Game)s
- [Coordination Game](Coordination_Game)

General Games

- [Median Voter Theorem](Median_Voter_Theorem) (also known as the [Allocation Problem](Allocation_Problem))
