# Point Estimate

### Points Estimates
An estimate is a point estimate when we use only one certain value to describe what we think about the whole population [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation]


### Examples
- $\bar{x}$ - sample mean, $\mu$ - population mean, $\bar{x}$ estimates $\mu$
- $\hat{p}$ - estimate of proportion, $p$ - true proportion
- $s$ - sample [Standard Deviation](Standard_Deviation), $\sigma$ - std of population
- etc

Point estimates are not necessarily good, but they tend to become better as we collect more data


### Standard Error
[Standard Error](Standard_Error) - a measure of uncertainty associated with this point estimate


### Confidence Intervals
A point estimate - is a single plausible value for a parameter 
- but one point is rarely enough - we'd like to have a range of plausible values 
- so we typically use [Confidence Intervals](Confidence_Intervals)
