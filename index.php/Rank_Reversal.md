## Rank Reversal
Many pair-wise comparison [MCDA](MCDA) methods (such as [ELECTRE](ELECTRE) and [PROMETHEE](PROMETHEE)) suffer from rank reversal:
- the relative position of two alternatives may be influenced by the presence of a third one  
- i.e. [Independence to Third Alternatives](Independence_to_Third_Alternatives) criterion is not satisfied

A position of two alternatives can be affected by 
- removing [Non-Discriminating Criteria](Non-Discriminating_Criteria) 
- removing / adding a copy of an alternative
- removing / adding a new criteria
- presence of a dominated alternative
- removing a dominated alternative

This may lead to:
- Risk of manipulation 


This issue occurs in:
- [ELECTRE](ELECTRE)
- [PROMETHEE](PROMETHEE) both I and II (see [Rank Reversal in PROMETHEE](PROMETHEE_Rank_Reversal))
