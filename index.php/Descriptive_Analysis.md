# Descriptive Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive statistics - how to summarize data with numbers or plots 


### Summaries
- Simple summaries - [Summary Statistics](Summary_Statistics) 
- [Exploratory Analysis](Exploratory_Analysis) - mostly visual analysis - simple-to-understand graphs.


## [Univariate Analysis](Univariate_Analysis)
Univariate analysis is describing the distribution of a single variable
- central tendency (e.g. the mean, median, and mode) 
- dispersion, e.g. 
  - the range and quantiles of the data set
  - measures of spread variance and standard deviation
- the shape of the distribution 
  - as skewness and kurtosis. 
  - graphical or tabular format, including histograms and stem-and-leaf display.


## [Bivariate Analysis](Bivariate_Analysis)
Descriptive statistics may be used to describe the relationship between pairs of variables

In this case, descriptive statistics include:
- Cross-Tabulations and Contingency Tables
- Graphical representation via [Scatter Plot](Scatter_Plot)s and other [Plots](Plots)
- Quantitative measures of dependence
- Descriptions of conditional distributions
