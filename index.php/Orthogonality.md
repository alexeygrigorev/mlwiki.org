# Orthogonality

## Orthogonality

There are several definitions of ''orthogonality'':
- Two Euclidean vectors are ''orthogonal'' if they are perpendicular, i.e., they form a right angle.
- Two vectors, $\mathbf x$ and $\mathbf y$ are ''orthogonal'' if their [Inner Product](Inner_Product) $\mathbf x^T \mathbf y = 0$ This relationship is denoted $\mathbf x \, \bot \, \mathbf y$: [Vector Orthogonality](Vector_Orthogonality)
- Two [Vector Subspaces](Vector_Subspaces) are ''orthogonal'' if each vector from one subspace is orthogonal to each vector of another subspace: [Space Orthogonality](Space_Orthogonality)
- Two [Functions](Functions) are orthogonal if their inner product is 0: [Orthogonal Functions](Orthogonal_Functions)
