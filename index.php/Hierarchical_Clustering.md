## Hierarchical Clustering
This is a part of [Cluster Analysis](Cluster_Analysis): we want to build a hierarchy of clusters 

Two major approaches:
- [Agglomerative Clustering](Agglomerative_Clustering): This is a "bottom up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
- [Divisive Clustering](Divisive_Clustering): This is a "top down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
