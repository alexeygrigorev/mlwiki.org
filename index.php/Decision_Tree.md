# Decision Tree

There are two types of Decision Trees:
- [Decision Tree (Decision Theory)](Decision_Tree_(Decision_Theory))
- [Decision Tree (Data Mining)](Decision_Tree_(Data_Mining))


In [Decision Analysis](Decision_Analysis), [decision trees](Decision_Tree_(Decision_Theory)) are used 
- to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. 


In [Data Mining](Data_Mining), 
- a [decision tree](Decision_Tree_(Data_Mining)) describes data but not decisions; 
- and the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making
